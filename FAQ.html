        <div id="q1" class="question">
            How to use a metered-dose inhaler without a spacer?
        </div>

        <div id="a1" class="answer">
            <p>Remove the cap. Hold the inhaler upright with the mouthpiece at the bottom. 
            Check to make sure that the mouthpiece is free of any foreign objects.
            Shake the inhaler well before use (3-4 shakes.)</p>
            <p>Sit upright, tilt the head back slightly and breathe out gently as you normally do, away from the inhaler.
            Hold the mouthpiece in your mouth between your teeth, above the tongue and close your lips around it.
            Start breathing in slowly, deeply and evenly.</p>
            <p>Press down on the canister once, until the medicine is released and continue to breathe in for a count of 3-5 seconds, i.e. until a full breath is taken.
            Hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as possible.</p>
            <p>Remove the mouthpiece from the mouth and breathe out slowly from the nose.
            Rinse and gargle with water using steroid medication (alone or in combination) but do not swallow the water.</p>

        <div id="q2" class="question">
            What are the adverse effects of tuberculosis medication?
        </div>

        <div id="a2" class="answer">
            <p>Tuberculosis requires multi-drug therapy to combat resistance. The common drugs used are isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin.
                </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Isoniazid- fever, skin rashes, hepatitis causing loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice and abdominal pain, neuropathy due to pyridoxine deficiency, memory loss, psychosis, ataxia, seizures, hematological abnormalities such as anemia, tinnitus, gastrointestinal discomfort.
                </li>
            <li>Rifampin- orange colored urine, sweat and tears leading to discoloration of contact lenses, rashes, nephritis, jaundice, fever, chills, muscle pain, dizziness, thrombocytopenia, anemia.
                </li>
            <li>Ethambutol- Retrobulbar neuritis resulting in loss of visual acuity and color blindness.
                </li>
            <li>Pyrazinamide- hepatotoxicity, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, increased risk of gout.
                </li>
            <li>Streptomycin-vertigo and hearing loss. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Contact your doctor if you experience any of these adverse effects.</p>

        <div id="q3" class="question">
            What is sleep apnea?
        </div>

        <div id="a3" class="answer">
            <p>Apnea means the absence of spontaneous breathing. Episodes of apnea occur during normal sleep. In people with sleep apnea, the frequency and duration of breathless episodes are increased. Each episode lasts for 10 seconds or longer and occurs 300 to 500 times each night. 
                </p>
            <p>Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by obstruction of the upper airway. Episodes consist of loud snoring, labored breathing, periods of no breathing, followed by snorts and gasps for air. These episodes are repeated multiple times in one night, resulting in fragmented sleep. Daytime drowsiness, increased heart rate, hypertension and a greatly elevated cardiovascular disease risk result from sleep apnea. 
                </p>
            <p>Central sleep apnea is caused by the transient abolition of the neural drive to the respiratory muscles. It is caused by damage to the central respiratory centers or abnormal respiratory neuromuscular apparatus. It is clinically similar to obstructive sleep apnea

        <div id="q4" class="question">
            What is COPD?
        </div>

        <div id="a4" class="answer">
            <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by an increased resistance due to a partial or complete obstruction in the conducting passages of the lungs. The air cannot leave the lungs and is trapped inside.
            </p>

            <p>
            Emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma and bronchiectasis are common obstructive lung diseases. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are clinically grouped together and referred to as COPD since the majority of patients have features of both. Tobacco smoking is a major cause.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="q5" class="question">
            What is the treatment of COPD?
        </div>

        <div id="a5" class="answer">
            <p>
                There is no complete cure, but it can be effectively managed by smoking cessation, lifestyle changes, medication and surgery.
            </p>

            <p>
                Medications include inhaled and oral glucocorticoids, bronchodilators like ÃŸ2-agonists and anticholinergics, theophylline, antibiotics and supplemental oxygen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Non-pharmacologic therapies include general medical care, vaccines, pulmonary rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery and lung transplantation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Acute exacerbations are treated by bronchodilators, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, oxygen and mechanical ventilator support.
            </p>

        <div id="q6" class="question">
            What is the treatment of asthma?
        </div>

        <div id="a6" class="answer">
            <p>
                Management aims at long term control and prevention of asthma attacks. Recognizing and avoiding triggers is essential.
            </p>

            <p>
                Medications include long acting drugs that reduce inflammation and short acting drugs that open airways in acute attacks
            </p>

            <p>
                Long-acting B2-agonists, anticholinergics, theophylline, inhaled corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, anti-leukotrienes, anti-IgE, immunotherapy is used in the long term treatment of asthma. A stepwise approach is taken according to the severity of symptoms.
            </p>

            <p>
                Acute severe asthma is treated by a high concentration of oxygen and short acting B2-agonists.
